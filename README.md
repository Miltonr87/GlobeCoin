### About

Made with **React** as SPA and inspired by features from financial investment companies like [Biscoint](https://biscoint.io/buy/btc/brl?amount=1000&isQuote=true) . The project uses Redux for Login System. The Web App consumes monetary data provided by **[Fixer API](https://fixer.io)** with **Axios** and converts the currencies to Bitcoin or any other currency chosen by he user. To build it I used the most modern tool in React documentation called **Hooks API** and the whole project was written using the technique of **Styled Components** for CSS. In addition, a **ChatBot** has been programmed in real time to interact with user who may have questions about the company.

### Getting Started

- Clone the repo (HTTP Protocol): ```git clone https://github.com/Miltonr87/GlobeCoin.git```
- Using NPM or Yarn to install the React APP and run the project on your computer. 

### Required:

As you see, **GlobeCoin** runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), so before you can continue, please ensure that you have it installed with NPM or Yarn. Once you have Node installed, you will need the React (17.01) library. So, to start the project in your machine, open your terminal inside the GlobeCoin folder and type "NPM Install" or "Yarn Install".
