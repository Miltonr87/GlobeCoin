### About

Made with **React** as SPA and inspired by features from financial investment companies like [XP Investimentos](ttps://www.xpi.com.br/) and [Biscoint](https://biscoint.io/buy/btc/brl?amount=1000&isQuote=true) . The project uses **Compound Components** as a pattern in the layout composition. Together with them, the Web App consumes monetary data provided by the **[Fixer API](https://fixer.io)** with **Axios** and converts the currencies to Bitcoin or to another currency chosen by the user. To build it I used the most modern tool in React documentation called **Hooks API** and the whole project was written using the technique of **Styled Components** for CSS, in addition to covering a **ChatBot** library in real time configured to interact with the user. 

### Getting Started

- Clone the repo (HTTP Protocol): ```git clone https://github.com/Miltonr87/GlobeCoin.git```
- Using NPM or Yarn to install the React APP and run the project on your computer. 

### Required:

As you see, **GlobeCoin** runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), so before you can continue, please ensure that you have it installed with NPM or Yarn. Once you have Node installed, you will need the React (17.01) library. So, to start the project in your machine, open your terminal inside the GlobeCoin folder and type "NPM Install" or "Yarn Install".
